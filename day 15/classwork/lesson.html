<h2>Laocoön and His Sons</h2>
<p>Laocoön and His Sons is an ancient sculpture which was excavated in Rome, Italy, in <br> 1506. It depicts the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being <br> attacked by sea serpents. The figures in the statue are nearly life-sized, with the entire <br> group measuring just over 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) in height. The statue is likely to be the same <br> one that received praise from the Roman writer Pliny the Elder, who attributed the work <br> (then housed in the palace of the emperor Titus) to three Greek sculptors from the island of <br> Rhodes: Agesander, Athenodoros and Polydorus, but he did not mention the work's date or <br> patron. Modern scholars are not certain of the work's origins; it might be an original work or <br> a copy of an earlier bronze sculpture. After its discovery, Laocoön and His Sons was put on <br> public display in the Vatican Museums, where it remains.</p>
